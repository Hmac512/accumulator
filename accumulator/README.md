# accumulator

Dynamic Positive and Universal accumulators according to the paper: [Dynamic Universal Accumulator with Batch Update over Bilinear Groups](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/777)
Provides
- a dynamic positive accumulator [`PositiveAccumulator`], that supports membership proofs.
- a dynamic universal accumulator [`UniversalAccumulator`], that supports membership and non-membership proofs.
- a zero knowledge proof of membership and non-membership in the accumulators with [`ProofProtocol`].

Allows
- single and batch updates (additions, removals or both) to the accumulators.
- single and batch updates to the witness.

Both accumulators implement that trait [`Accumulator`] that contains the common functionality.
Both [`MembershipWitness`] and [`NonMembershipWitness`] can be updated either using secret key or using public
info published by accumulator manager called [`Omega`].
Most of the update logic is in the trait [`Witness`] which is implemented by both [`MembershipWitness`]
and [`NonMembershipWitness`].
The implementation tries to use the same variable names as the paper and thus violate Rust's naming conventions at places.
